The Kessler 10 plus (K10+) consumer self assessment was designed by Ronald
Kessler as a short measure of non-specific psychological distress. It has been
adapted for use as part of the NOCC suite of measures by the addition of 4
questions to assess the degree of disability being experienced by the consumer.

The K10+ is reproduced in `Mental Health National Outcomes
and Casemix Collection: Overview of clinical and self-report measures and data
