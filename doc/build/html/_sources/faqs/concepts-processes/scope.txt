Questions about the scope of the MDS
------------------------------------

PHNs raised a number of questions regarding the scope of the MDS and whether specific
areas of commissioned activity were intended to be covered.
The `Overview paper <https://www.pmhc-mds.com/doc/pmhc-mds-overview-20160916.pdf>`_
covers the scope issue (page 4), an extract of which is copied below:

  “The new arrangements are designed to capture data on PHN-commissioned mental
  health services **delivered to individual clients, including group-based delivery to individual clients …**

  **The scope of coverage will not extend to services targeted at communities,** such as
  the community capacity building activities previously funded under projects sourced
  from National Suicide Prevention Program funding. Collection and reporting of
  activities of this type requires a different approach to ‘counting’ and identification of
  the ‘client’.  PHNs commissioning activities of this type will have flexibility to establish
  local data reporting arrangements that suit requirements.”

PHNs raised a number of questions to further clarify the scope of the PMHC MDS,
summarised below.


.. _community-based-suicide-prevention-activities:

Coverage of community-based suicide prevention activities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Activities such as mental health and suicide awareness training and whole of community health promotion programs (non-clinical services) (e.g., Farm-Link). targeted at groups or whole communities, are not a good fit for the PHMC MDS They are currently reported to the National Suicide Prevention Program) MDS which finishes on the 30th June 2016. What is the mechanism for the future?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PHN-commissioned services of this type are outside the scope of the PMHC MDS.

Regional whole-of-community suicide prevention activities previously funded
directly by the Department and now transferred to PHNs (e.g., Farm-Link) have
previously reported to the National Suicide Prevention Program MDS managed by
Australian Healthcare Associates under contract to the Department.  The Department
is currently exploring options to continue this collection and will advise PHNs
accordingly, with a view to ensuring continuity of reporting of community-based
suicide prevention activities.

Suicide prevention oriented services provided to individuals are in scope for
collection and reporting to the PMHC MDS.


Coverage of digital health services
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Are the PHNs expected to collect and upload all of the data outlined under the 6 Mental Health Priority Areas? If so it will be difficult to collect this data for referrals made to e-mental health sites such as mood gym, mind spot etc. There are also challenges around self-help groups.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As indicated, scope of coverage is all PHN-commissioned mental health services
delivered to individual clients, regardless of mode of service delivery.

Digital health services present particular challenges that need to be unbundled
to resolve a way forward.  Where PHNs refer the consumer to self-help, clinician
unmoderated assistance (e.g., Mood Gym), this is not a PHN-commissioned service
as such and falls outside of the scope of collection.  Similarly, referral to a
nationally funded clinician-moderated service such as Mindspot is not a PHN-commissioned
services and falls outside of scope, bypassing the need for data collection.

However, there are acknowledged issues where a PHN enters a funding agreement
with a digital health provider to provide individually tailored, clinician-moderated
services to specific populations within their regions.  Such services clearly fall
within scope.  The Department is considering the options to capture the required
data. These include setting up arrangements for digital providers to collect and
submit data on behalf of PHNs.


Coverage of whole of region services regardless of who funds
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Are we only reporting on services and processes that we are commissioning and undertaking or the region as a whole?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The PMHC MDS is designed to cover only those services commissioned by PHNs.


Appropriateness of occasions of service as a counting measure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This unit of counting is not appropriate for the full range of services that might be commissioned by PHNs, for example, whole of community-oriented prevention activities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is agreed.  The scope of the PMHC MDS does not cover every activity that a
PHN may commission.

Where activities are outside the scope of the PMHC MDS, PHNS are expected to
set up their own arrangements to collect data suitable for reporting purposes.
See also the response above regarding :ref:`community-based-suicide-prevention-activities`.


.. _Exclusion-of-non-clinical-time:

Exclusion of ‘non clinical’ time
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The MDS only captures actual clinical time. Administrative tasks such as arranging for case conferences, updating electronic health information records, undertaking program contractual management tasks, travelling to service provision venue amongst others, are currently not being captured.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The focus of the PMHC MDS collection is on clinical service delivery to individual
clients. It is acknowledged that clinician have to undertake other activities to
maintain their clinical work and time spent on these can be significant.  However,
any broadening of scope to include as mandatory other activities would create an
unacceptable data reporting burden on clinical service providers, all of whom are
practitioners independent of the PHN.

It should be noted however that the PMHC MDS differs from the previous ATAPS collection
in allowing a range of services delivered ‘on behalf’ of the client to be recorded.
Section 4.4 of the Overview paper (‘Determining what activities are in scope for
reporting as service contacts”) provides the relevant details.


Are headspace services covered by the requirements?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Are services funded through headspace expected to collect the PHMC MDS?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First-stage development of the MDS will not include existing youth-specific services
(headspace, Early Psychosis Youth Services) that currently collect and report
a standardised dataset to headspace National Office.  Pending the future of these
arrangements, and access to data by PHNs, the PHMC MDS can be expanded at a
future stage to allow incorporation of headspace and Early Psychosis Youth Services
should this be required.


Are EPYS centres covered?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Are services funded as Early Psychosis Centres expected to collect the PHMC MDS?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First-stage development of the MDS will not include existing youth-specific services
(headspace, Early Psychosis Youth Services) that currently collect and report
a standardised dataset to headspace National Office.  Pending the future of these
arrangements, and access to data by PHNs, the PHMC MDS can be expanded at a
future stage to allow incorporation of headspace and Early Psychosis Youth Services
should this be required.
