Reserved Tags
=============

This document defines the Department reserved tags used to identify specific
records types in the Primary Mental Health Care Minimum Data Set (PMHC MDS).
Tags beginning with an exclamation mark (``!``) are reserved for future use by
the Department.

Tags field definitions for each record type are available in
:ref:`record-formats`.

!br20 - Australian Government Mental Health Response to Bushfire
----------------------------------------------------------------

PHNs in fire affected communities are funded through the *Australian Government
Mental Health Response to Bushfire Trauma* to deliver services including:

  * Front line emergency distress and trauma counselling, with up to 10 free
    mental health support sessions for individuals, families and emergency
    services personnel
  * ‘Surge capacity’ mental health services to individuals and families who are
    affected, and
  * Increased demand for headspace sites in fire affected areas.

The PMHC MDS reporting changes are designed to capture this funded service
activity through the reserved Episode tag ``!br20``.

   Minimum Data Set Circular 2020/01 – January 2020 </_static/PMHCMDS Circular

.. _br20-funded-PHNS:

PHNs who received funding
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PHNs funded through the *Australian Government Mental Health Response to
Bushfire Trauma* **must** apply the bushfire response tag to all episodes where
one or more service contacts is funded by the response.

For these PHNs, the service provider should apply the bushfire response tag to:

New clients
"""""""""""

  * Who are accessing services funded through the *Australian Government Mental
    Health Response to Bushfire Trauma*
  * Whose access to a mental health service was prompted by exposure to
    bushfire (e.g. their stated reason for approaching a service is their
    recent exposure to bushfire), and/or
  * Whose mental health service need was significantly increased by their
    exposure to bushfire (e.g. based on the judgement of the service provider).

Existing clients
""""""""""""""""

i.e. clients with an open episode.

  * Who are accessing services funded through the *Australian Government Mental
    Health Response to Bushfire Trauma*, and/or
  * Whose mental health service need was significantly increased by their
    exposure to bushfire (e.g. additional or higher intensity services are
    required).

.. _br20-non-funded-PHNS:

PHNs who did **not** receive funding
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PHNs who did not receive funding for *Australian Government Mental Health
Response to Bushfire Trauma* activities may use the PMHC MDS reporting changes
to capture the service response to bushfire trauma.

For these PHNs, the service provider should apply the bushfire response tag to:

New clients
"""""""""""

  * Whose access to a mental health service was prompted by exposure to
    bushfire (e.g. their stated reason for approaching a service is their
    recent exposure to bushfire), and/or
  * Whose mental health service need was significantly increased by their
    exposure to bushfire (e.g. based on the judgement of the service provider).

Existing clients
""""""""""""""""

i.e. clients with an open episode.

  * Whose mental health service need was significantly increased by their
    exposure to bushfire (e.g. additional or higher intensity services are
    required).

.. _br20-Data-Entry:

How to apply the tag in the PMHC MDS Data Entry interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The bushfire response tag is available for use on an episode record and is
denoted ``!br20``.

There are two ways to apply the tag through the PMHC MDS data entry interface:

  1. Manual data entry by typing the tag ``!br20`` to the Episode tag field.

      * When entering data directly, episodes will need to be tagged with the
        string ``!br20``. The data entry system already allows for the tagging
        of records and therefore it is possible to implement this immediately
        by communicating the instructions to users.
      * Please note the free text nature of the tag system increases the
        opportunity for errors because it is easy to mistype a tag. This should
        be emphasised in communications with users.

  2. Tick the box labelled ‘Australian Government Mental Health Response to
     Bushfire’.

      * This tick box automatically adds/removes the tag when ticked/unticked.
        This functionality will be available by 24 January 2020.

The checkbox is on the Episode add and edit screen:

  * Ticking the checkbox will add the ``!br20`` tag to the tag field
  * Typing the ``!br20`` tag into the tag box will also tick the checkbox
  * Unticking the ``!br20`` checkbox will remove the ``!br20`` tag
  * Deleting the ``!br20`` tag from the tag field will also untick the checkbox

!covid19 - Australian Government HeadtoHelp hubs
------------------------------------------------

The Australian Government is providing funding to Victorian PHNs to deliver
services through HeadtoHelp hubs as part of its response to the mental health
impact of COVID-19.

The department is implementing a new tag in the PMHC MDS to capture activity
associated with the HeadtoHelp hubs.

This change only applies to PHNs in Victoria.

The department will introduce further data collection requirements for
HeadtoHelp activity in the coming weeks and is consulting with PHNs. The
Department will advise Victorian PHNs of new data collection requirements in future circular/s.


New 'Australian Government HeadtoHelp hubs' tag (!covid19)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Department has introduced an ‘Australian Government HeadtoHelp hubs’ tag to the PMHC MDS.

All clients who either call the 1800 HeadtoHelp number or present in person
at a HeadtoHelp hub and are identified as HeadtoHelp hub clients will be
assessed through the ‘HeadtoHelp Victorian Mental Health Hubs Intake Assessment
and Referral Model of Care’ as outlined in the contract. Clients will be
referred to the most suitable service, which may be at a HeadtoHelp hub.

The PHN *must* apply ‘Australian Government HeadtoHelp hubs’ tag (!covid19) to
episodes of care initiated for clients who have been referred to the hub
through the IAR process and are receiving services funded through the
HeadtoHelp hubs contracts.

Considerations for applying reserved tags in data uploads
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Users of local third-party or in-house developed systems will need to address
varying issues depending on the capability of the system. When considering
options please be aware the PMHC MDS specification does not require that data
is captured in the same manner as it is supplied during upload.

For example, an ideal solution could be to add an extensible multiple choice
“Tags” field to local episode data entry screens. This could initially include
an “Australian Government Mental Health Response to Bushfire” option thereby
providing the organisation control over the possible tags that can be captured.
By ensuring that additional options were easily added in the future such a
field would support future special access programs without significant changes,
as well as other purposes local or as requested by the Department.

An alternative approach, requiring less development, would be to extend an
existing local field at the episode level with an “Australian Government Mental
Health Response to Bushfire” option. This gives the organisation control over
the values that may be selected.

In both of the above examples, development work would also be required in the
data extraction process used to produce PMHC MDS compliant upload files. An
endorsement of “Australian Government Mental Health Response to Bushfire” via
either method would be converted to the tag !br20 on the extracted episode
records where appropriate.

An alternative but not preferred option is that episode records could be
uploaded and then subsequently manually tagged via the data entry interface.
This would require significant manual processes and double handling but it is a
use case supported by the PMHC MDS.

If you have queries about managing data upload processes please contact the
PMHC MDS helpdesk at support@pmhc-mds.com.
